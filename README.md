# Enhanced Battle Test

A mod for Mount&Blade Bannerlord that provides more powerful custom battle.

## Features
- You can choose multiplayer characters or singleplayer characters that are used in campaign mode.

  You can choose at most 8 groups of troops for each side.

- For multiplayer characters, you can choose perks, which is the same as in multiplayer mode.

- For singleplayer characters, you can choose all the characters in campaign mode, except companions, as they are generated dynamically.

- You can adjust gender ratio for each group of troops.

- You can customize the banner of each team in banner editor in singleplayer mode, with copy-paste feature.

- Configuration saving. The battle configuration is saved in "(user directory)\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs\EnhancedBattleTest\".

  The configuration for multiplayer mode is saved in "mpconfig.xml" and that for singleplayer mode is saved in "spconfig.xml".

## How to install
1. Copy `Modules` folder into Bannerlord installation folder(For example `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord - Beta`). It should be merged with `Modules` of the game. Or use Vortex to install it automatically.

   Note that the other files should not be installed. They are source files used to build the mod and are for those who want to modify the mod.

## How to use
- Start the launcher and choose Single player mode. In `Mods` panel select `EnhancedBattleTest` mod and click `PLAY`.

- After starting:
  - Select a mode to play in main menu. Singpleplayer mode may be slow to load because it would start a campaign game to load all the data. This problem may be resolved in the future.

  - You can select troops for each side of teams.

  - Click `Start` to enjoy the battle.

## Troubleshoot
- If the launcher can not start:

  - Uninstall all the third-party mods and reinstall them one by one to detect which one cause the launcher cannot start.

- If it shows "Unable to initialize Steam API":

  - Please start steam first, and make sure that Bannerlord is in your steam account.

- If the game crashed after starting:

  - Please uncheck the mod in launcher and wait for mod update.

    Optionally you can tell me the step to reproduce the crash.

- If the mod exited without showing any message when loading battles:

  - Try to reduce soldier numbers or graphic quality.
